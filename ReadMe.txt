GeoPVA v 1.0
Geographic Port Vulnerability Analysis
jbeer@protonmail.com

GeoPVA can do the following:
-Scan an IP2location database for selection of ip ranges by country, state, city, or zip code.
- Create a whitelist file for nmap scanning based on location searches.
- Filter through nmap scans -active ip and port scans- to determine the percentage of ports open in specific geographic areas.

This program is a compilation of python scripts developed for my Capstone computer science project at John Jay CUNY.
A link to our original report is here:

For this program to work you will need the following python scripts installed:

Pandas            
ipaddress
netaddr
IP2location.py is needed and provided. 

Please note:

- This program is only as accurate as the database being used. 
  As this is using an older free version from IP2location, I would not expect accurate results. 
- This program works for IP4 addresses only.

Feel free to contact me with comments, questions or job opportunities.
